\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify headlines: c, d, e.
  \item Activate f-sa1. Assign D' to f.
  \item Backward implication: c = e = 1, a = b = 0.
  \item Since G4 is an unique D-frontier, perform unique sensitization. Assign 0 to g.
  \item Backward implication: d = 0.
  \item Forward implication: h = D. The fault has reached the primary output.
  \item No justification needed. Test generated, (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 1, 0).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer}: (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 1, 0).
