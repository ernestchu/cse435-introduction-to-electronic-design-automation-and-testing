\begin{enumerate}
  \item Activate G5 SA0. Initial objective: G5's output = 1.
  \item Backtrace to A. With an even inversion parity, A = 1. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to B. With an even inversion parity, B = 1. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to C. With an old inversion parity, C = 0. Simulation, objective achieved.
  \item Propagate the fault. Objective: G7's second input = 0.
  \item No more unknown primary input to backtrace to. Simulation, objective achieved.
  \item Test generated, (A, B, C) = (1, 1, 0).

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer:} (A, B, C) = (1, 1, 0).
