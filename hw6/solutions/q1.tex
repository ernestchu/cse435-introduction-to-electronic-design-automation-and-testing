\begin{enumerate}
  \item Activate G5 SA0. Initial objective: (G5, D').
  \item Backtrace to A. With an even inversion parity, A = 1. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to B. With an even inversion parity, B = 1. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to C. With an odd inversion parity, C = 0. Simulation, objective achieved. The fault has reached the primary output.
  \item Test generated, (A, B, C) = (1, 1, 0).

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer:} (A, B, C) = (1, 1, 0).
