(1) do not check the controllability of each line, so it don't make intermediate objectives. It just sets the primary input based on the inversion parity of the entire backtracing path.

(2)/(3) utilize the controllability of each line to choose the backtracing path. They thus set the intermediate objectives in order to apply the heuristics. These heuristics reduce the possibility of encountering a conflict in comparison to (1).
