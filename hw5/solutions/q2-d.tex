\begin{enumerate}
  \item Activate f-sa1. Initial objective: f = 0.
  \item Since G2 is an imply gate, backtrace to the hardest PI, a. With an even inversion parity, a = 0. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to the next hardest PI, b. With an even inversion parity, b = 0, e = 1. Simulation, objective not achieved.
  \item Backtrace to the next hardest PI, c. With an odd inversion parity, c = 1. Simulation, objective achieved.
  \item Propagate the fault. Objective: g = 0.
  \item Backtrace to the remaining PI, d. With an odd inversion parity, d = 1. Simulation, g = $(\text{c}\oplus\text{d})'$ = 0. Conflict with the objective. Flip d to 0. Simulation, objective achieved.
  \item Test generated, (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 1, 0).

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer:} (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 1, 0).
