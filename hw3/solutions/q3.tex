The test pattern can be given as the table below. Each row is a clock tick, and at the initial tick, $\text{Q}_\text{n}$ is in the don't-care condition. For all the following ticks, $\text{Q}_\text{n}$ is the $\text{Q}_\text{n+1}$ from the previous tick.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c c | c | c}
    J & K & $\text{Q}_\text{n+1}$ & Functions \\
    \hline
    0 & 1 & 0 & set 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & hold 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & set 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & hold 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & toggle to 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & toggle to 1 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
If output does not meet the expectation, a functional fault is detected in the F/F. One of the set, hold or toggle to 0/1 functions could not behave properly.
