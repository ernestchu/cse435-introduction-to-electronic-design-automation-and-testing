\paragraph{Single}
Both the numbers of faults of SST and SSA fault are multiples of the numbers of transitions and lines, respectively. However, the multiplier of the SST fault depends on the number of states, while the one of the SSA is fixed to 2 (sa0, sa1).
\paragraph{Multiple}
In the power of both the numbers of faults of SST and SSA fault. The exponents are the numbers of transitions and lines, respectively. However, the base of the MST fault depends on the number of states, while the one of the MSA is fixed to 3 (no-error, sa0, sa1).
