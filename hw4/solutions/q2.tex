A fault $\alpha$ is said to dominate another fault $\beta$ in an irredundant circuit, iff every test for $\beta$ is also a test for $\alpha$. If f dominates g, then every test for g is also a test for f. If g dominates h, then every test for h is also a test for g. Since every test for g is a test for f, every test for h is thus also a test for f.
