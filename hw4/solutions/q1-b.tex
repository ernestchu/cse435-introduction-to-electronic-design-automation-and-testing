Denote K as the number of lines in the circuit.

\paragraph{Single-stuck-at (SSA) fault}
The SSA fault would occur at either one of the lines, and in the SSA faults, there will be the case of stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1. So the number of distinguishable SSA faults would be 2K.
\paragraph{Multiple-stuck-at (MSA) fault}
For each lines, there are three possible cases: no-error, stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1. With K lines, there would be $\text{3}^\text{K}$ possible circuits, including $\text{3}^\text{K}$-1 faulty ones and 1 fault-free one.
