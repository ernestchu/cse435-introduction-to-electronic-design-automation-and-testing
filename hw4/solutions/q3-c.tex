With fault equivalence, s-a-1 at \textbf{f} is equivalent to s-a-1 at \textbf{g}, and we can keep only one of them. Likewise, s-a-1 at \textbf{i} is equivalent to s-a-1 at \textbf{e}. The number of SSA faults is thus once again reduced by 2, leaving only 8 SSA faults after applying fault equivalence.
