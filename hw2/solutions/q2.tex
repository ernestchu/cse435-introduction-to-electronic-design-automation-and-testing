When $R_C$ is abnormally high, the output would become slow to charge, which leads to the gate-delay fault. The time required to charge the capacitor $\tau$, which can be formulated as $\tau = RC$, where $R$ is the resistance, and $C$ is the capacitance, thus $\tau \propto R$. The delay is increased by 100 times as well.

To test the charging delay fault, we should first clear the output by setting (A, B) to (0, 1), (1, 0), or (1, 1). At the second time frame, we set (A, B) to (0, 0) to charge the circuit and observe the output to test if it produces significant delay.

\textbf{Answer:} At time frame 1, (A, B) = (0, 1), (1, 0), or (1, 1). At time frame 2, (A, B) = (0, 0).
